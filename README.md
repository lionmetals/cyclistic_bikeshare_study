How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success? 

Scenario: 
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations


Business Task:
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

Prepare and Process Data:

Step 4: Further Clean-Up and v2
-Various trips where ride_length returns a negative duration. These entries were omitted from the data_frame.
-The rideable_type "docked_bike" designates bikes that were taken out of circulation by Cyclistic to assess for quality control
-Decreased from 5733351 to 5552874 observations
